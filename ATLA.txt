Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of my favorite animated shows. 
I've been rewatching it over the weekend and every time I rewatch it, I fall in love with it all over again.
 The characters are all brilliantly crafted with amazing backstories and expert character development.
It also reminds me how horrible the movie adaptation was for this show. I can't believe they even had the same story arc.
I genuinely think that Avatar will last through the generations as being one of the best cartoons of all time.
