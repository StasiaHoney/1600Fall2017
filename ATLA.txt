Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of my favorite animated shows. 
I've been rewatching it over the weekend and every time I rewatch it, I fall in love with it all over again.
 The characters are all brilliantly crafted with amazing backstories and expert character development.
It also reminds me how horrible the movie adaptation was for this show. I can't believe they even had the same story arc.
I genuinely think that Avatar will last through the generations as being one of the best cartoons of all time.

The Legend of Korra is in the same universe as ATLA but I don't think it was nearly as good.
It was a good watch and I definitely enjoyed watching it and I have even rewatched it a couple of times.
The problem with TLOK is that it was created to make money off the ATLA audience,
 so the story is a little all over the place.
The characters aren't nearly as likeable as in ATLA (though I really enjoyed Bolin and the Bei Fang sisters).
I also really didn't like how the view of disabilities changed from ATLA to TLOK...
In ATLA, Toph is a blind earthbender and that makes her one of the strongest characters in the show.
In TLOK, however, I found that disability was treated like something to pity especially right after Korra gets poisoned.
Korra was always a strong willed character and the poison really showed that in her recovery, however, I don't think
that it was very well done in the initial part of the recovery because she is just shown as being weak.
I like that Toph kicked Korra's but about getting the rest of the poison out.

Sorry for the long rant.
