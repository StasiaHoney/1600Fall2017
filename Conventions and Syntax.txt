Coding Syntax is the structure of the language (in our case it's C#).
Conventions are tools to write code.

The dot ( . ) is used to seperate words within lines of code that are connected:
example: Systems.Collections.Generic

The semicolon is used to end a line of code within a body or function
example: print("Hello");

To make a comment the computer will not read use // for a single line
example: //this won't be in the output of the code
or /* (text) */ for a multiple line comment
example: /*this is a long comment
	with a lot of lines
	See? */

Curly braces {} are used for functions (tells what to do) to open and close the funciton.
example: void Start () {
		print("Hello");
	}
