To be able to animate has been a dream of mine since I watched Howl's Moving Castle: a Studio Ghibli film. 
The animation in the film was so goregous and graceful. The smooth animation and style of the art has inspired me since I was 11.

Another one of my inspiriations is Naughty Dog games. The Uncharted games were my first console games ever. I didn't think much of the
company until I played The Last Of Us in 2013. TLOU is--in my opinion--the best story game ever made. The pacing is perfect, the animaiton
is incredible (for it's time), and the emotion of the game was just heart-wrenching. I didn't think I wanted to be a game animator until I 
played Uncharted 4 last year. The animation is top-notch, using all the latest tech that Sony has to offer. That's when I knew that video
game animaiton is what I wanted to do.

sorry for the long rambling.
