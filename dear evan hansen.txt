I just wanted to fangirl a bit about the new musical I've been listening to lately. (Dear Evan Hansen)
I know you probably don't care but that's not the point of the assignment now is it?
I love the message of Suicide it presents, even though it is a little bit intense at times.
I think the songs really add to the whole suicide and depression and social anxiety thing.
I've never really dealt with that but I have a lot of friends who have
 and this show helps me see into their feelings a bit more.
Really love the musical and that's about it.
