I enjoy Doctor Who...
I'm tired.
I'm tired because my silly roommate decided to stay up all night watching Harry Potter and I like Harry Potter so I stayed up until movie 3,
which ended up being like midnight.
I'm unhappy because I am currently unable to watch the latest season of Doctor Who. As I have mentioned before, I like Doctor Who. Therefore,
this inability saddens me.
